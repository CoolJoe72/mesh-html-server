<h1>TeamTalk 4 Classic for Accessibility</h1>
The TeamTalk 4 application uses a framework called <a target="_blank"
 href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt</a> for designing the
user interface and unfortunately this doesn't work well with
screen-readers. For this reason a simplified version of the TeamTalk 4
application has been included with the TeamTalk 4 Windows installer
called
TeamTalk 4 Classic which works
well with screen-readers.<br>
<br>
To install TeamTalk 4 Classic for accessibility run the installer and
in the "Select Components" page choose "TeamTalk 4 Classic for
Accessibility".<br>
