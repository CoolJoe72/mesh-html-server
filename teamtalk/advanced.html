<h2><a name="settingsfile"></a>Load settings file</h2>
By default the TeamTalk client first looks in the directory of the
executable for its settings file (TeamTalk4.ini). If the settings file
isn't located there it will instead load its settings from the
user-profile's directory. On Windows 7 the user-profile directory is
typically located in "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming" and on Windows
XP it's in "C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data". On
Linux and Mac the settings are located in $HOME/.config/BearWare.dk.<br>
<h3>Multiple client instances<br>
</h3>
Since the TeamTalk executable first tries to load settings from its own
directory it's possible to run multiple TeamTalk clients with different
settings. Simply create a new directory, copy TeamTalk4.exe and
TeamTalk4.dll to that directory and create a file called TeamTalk4.ini
(TeamTalk.xml in the Classic client). Launch TeamTalk4.exe and it will
use the local settings file instead of the settings file in the
user-profile.<br>
