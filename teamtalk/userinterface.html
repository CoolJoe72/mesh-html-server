    <h2><a name="mwindow"></a>Main Window</h2>
    The TeamTalk application consists of a menubar, a toolbar, a
    channels
    view in the left side with volume controls below and a tab control
    with
    four tabs to the right. Between the channels view and the tab
    control
    is a so-called splitter which can be used to change the size of the
    channels view and tab control. <br>
    <br>
    The following screenshot is included to help explain the TeamTalk
    application's user interface.<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><a name="mainwindow"></a><img alt="Main Window"
        src="mainwindow.png"><br>
    </div>
    <h3><a name="menubar"></a>Menu Bar<br>
    </h3>
    In the top of the application are six menu-items: <a
      href="#clientmenu">Client</a>,
    <a href="#memenu">Me</a>, <a href="#usersmenu">Users</a>,
    <a href="#channelsmenu">Channels</a>, <a href="#servermenu">Server</a>
    and <em>Help</em>. The <em>Client</em>-menu is for configuring the
    TeamTalk application and connecting to servers. The <em>Me</em>-menu
gives
    access to options which should be set for the local user
    (meaning you), like e.g. changing your nickname or
    status. The <em>Users</em>-menu is used to control other users,
    like
    e.g. changing their sound volume or sending them
    text-messages. The <em>Channels</em>-menu is used for controlling
    channels, like e.g. creating new channels or updating existing ones.
    The <em>Server</em>-menu is for changing or viewing the server's
    options and finally the <em>Help</em>-menu is for assistance.<br>
    <h3><a name="toolbar"></a>Toolbar<br>
    </h3>
    The toolbar simply provides easy access to common tasks which are
    also
    available though the menu items.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect button</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The first button in the toolbar, which
          looks like a plug, is for connecting to a server.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Enable Push to Talk button</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The second button in the toolbar, which looks like a button,
          is for enabling a push to talk button. Push to talk is a key
          combination which must be held down whenever you are talking.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Enable Voice Activation button<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The third button, which looks like waves, are for enabling
          voice activation. Enabling this wil make a slider show up
          below the
          channels view. Move this slider left and right either changes
          the
          voice activation level.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Enable Video Transmission button<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The fourth button, which looks like a webcamera, is for
          enabling video transmission. Before this can be used a camera
          must be
          set up in the <a href="preferences.html#videocapture">Video
            Capture</a>-tab in <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a>.
          Once
          the camera is started one can click the Video-tab in the tab
          control
          to see one self.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Enable Desktop Sharing button<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The fifth button, which looks like a blackboard, is for
          sharing
          a desktop application with other users in the same channel.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Mute All button<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The sixth button in the toolbar, with a speaker icon, is
          for muting all users in the channel you're participating in,
          so you can
          no longer hear them.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Start/stop Recording Audio Files button</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The seventh button, which looks like a record button, is for
          storing audio files to disk.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Show Blinking Icon button</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The last button, which looks like a hand, is for enabling
          the
          Question status mode. This will make you appear as a user with
          a blink
          hand.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="channelsview"></a>Channels View</h3>
    The channels view is in the left side of the application above the
    volume controls. Once you have connected to a server you will see
    channels and users appearing here. The channels will appear as
    folder
    icons and the computer icon in the top is also a channel, namely the
    root channel, where you will first appear when you connect to a
    server. The user impersonating you will appear with bold text, so in
    the <a href="#packetloss">screenshot</a> below
    <em>Bjoern</em> is me. The blue box surrounding the user-icon means
    that I'm currently transmitting video, so the other users in the
    channel can see <i>Bjoern</i> in
    the <a href="#videotab">Video</a>-tab. The user <em>Ida</em> is
    also
    transmitting video but the blinking red line on her name means that
    the reception from her is very poor (video data is being lost). The
    user <em>Randi</em> has a green line over her name which means that
    she's currently transmitting audio, i.e. other users in the channel
    are hearing her talking. The blackboard behind <em>Randi</em>'s
    user-icon means that she sharing a desktop application which can be
    seen in the <a href="#desktopstab">Desktops</a>-tab.<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="Packetloss" src="mainwindow.png">
      <a name="packetloss"></a><br>
      <div align="left"><a name="packetloss"><br>
          Notice
          that <em>Bjoern</em> in the above screenshot has a red star.
          This
          means the user is administrator of the server. The user <em>Randi</em>
          has a yellow star which means she is operator of the channel
          and can
          thereby kick people out of the channel and modify the
          channel's
          settings. People who are operators are usually the users who
          created
          the channel.<br>
        </a></div>
    </div>
    <h3><a name="volcontrols"></a>Volume Controls</h3>
    The volume controls are placed below the channels view. The first
    slider with a speaker to the left of it controls the master volume.
    Changing this increases or decreases the volume for all users. If
    you
    only want to change the volume of one person you can select this
    person
    and press <code>Ctrl+Left</code> arrow to lower volume and <code>Ctrl+Right</code>
    arrow to increase the volume. These two keyboard shortcuts are
    placed
    in the <a href="#advanced">Advanced</a>-menu. The slider
    below the master
    volume with a microphone to the left controls your microphone's gain
    level, i.e. amplifying your volume so you become louder to other
    users.
    To the right of master volume is progressbar with a wave to the left
    of
    it. This progressbar shows how much sound your microphone is picking
    up. If voice activation is enabled the there will be a slider below
    the
    progressbar which sets the voice activation level. When using the
    voice
    activation slider to set the voice activation level ensure that it
    is
    not active all the time, since it can be annoying for other users.
    When
    voice activation becomes active the user in the channels view
    impersonating you will become green.<br>
    <h3><a name="chattab"></a>Chat Tab</h3>
    The <i>Chat</i>-tab is used for text chatting with the people in
    your
    channel.
    A screenshot is shown there:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="Chat tab" src="mainwindow.png">
    </div>
    <br>
    The Chat-tab also maintains a list of events which occurred in your
    channel, like
    e.g. when a new user joins or leaves the channel. To send a text
    message to all users in your channel simply type in the line to the
    left of the <em>Send</em>-button. If the server supports channel
    commands it's also possible to send commands to the server using
    channel text messages. Simply type <code>/help</code> to get a list
    of
    supported commands.<br>
    <h3><a name="videotab"></a>Video Tab</h3>
    The <i>Video</i>-tab contains a grid of all the users who are
    currently
    transmitting video to the channel. The users who are transmitting
    video
    will have a blue frame around their user icon in the channels view
    as
    can
    be seen in the following screenshot:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="Video tab" src="videotab.png"><br>
      <br>
    </div>
    The button with the '-' sign in the Video-tab can be used to remove
    users from the grid so you will no longer receive video data from
    that
    user. Pressing the button with the '+' sign will add the user to the
    grid again. The button with the two frames, one above the other, is
    for detaching a user from the grid so the user will be shown in a
    separate window. The last button the Video-tab is for starting and
    stopping your video camera. If you want other users to also see
    video
    sent from you press the video camera in the toolbar to the right of
    the voice activation icon.<br>
    <h3><a name="desktopstab"></a>Desktops Tab<br>
    </h3>
    The <i>Desktops</i>-tab contains a grid of shared desktop
    applications. Here is a screenshot of a shared desktop application:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="Desktops tab" src="desktopstab.png"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    Moving your mouse over the desktop window will show who owns the
    desktop. Press and hold the mouse to scroll the window if it's
    bigger
    than the Desktops tab. Check out the <a href="#desktopshare">Desktop
Share
      section</a> on how to share a desktop application.<br>
    <h3><a name="filestab"></a>Files Tab</h3>
    If the server allows, users can upload and download files to and
    from a
    channel. When you join a channel you can see the files which are
    currently available in the <em>Files</em>-tab as shown in this
    screenshot:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="Files tab" src="filestab.png"><br>
      <div align="left"><br>
        Only users who have a user account on the server can upload
        files.
        Anyone can download files in a channel. Only the owner of a
        file, an
        administrator or an operator of a channel can delete a file.
        Instead of
        using the upload and download button in the <em>Files-</em>tab
        one
        can also drag/drop files from Windows' Explorer.<br>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2><a name="clientmenu"></a>Client-Menu</h2>
    <div align="left">The <em>Client-</em>menu is used for connecting
      to
      TeamTalk servers and configuring the TeamTalk application.

            <h3><a name="pushtotalk"></a>Push To Talk Dialog</h3>
            Using Push To Talk is a good way to ensure people do not
            overlap each
            other when they are talking and to avoid echos from
            speakers. To set up
            a hotkey simply hold down the keys you want to use as your
            key
            combination and release them all again. The Push To Talk
            dialog will
            show the keys you're holding down like here.<br>
            <br>
            <div align="center"><img alt="Push To Talk"
                src="pushtotalk.png"><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Using <code>Ctrl</code> is a good choice for a Push To Talk
            key. Note
            that using regular keys can make Windows beep unlike when
            using
            non-modifier keys like <code>Ctrl</code>, <code>Alt</code>,
            <code>Shift</code>.
            Therefore
            <code>Ctrl</code> or <code>Alt</code> or <code>Shift</code>
            is recommended.<br>
            <h3><a name="desktopshare"></a>Enable Desktop Sharing Dialog</h3>
            The window of an application on your desktop can be shared
            with other
            users in the same channel. This can be used for doing a
            presentation in
            an eLearning scenario. The Desktop Sharing dialog is shown
            here:<br>

                      share your

                      have keyboard
                      and mouse focus. This option is useful if you
                      intend to show several
                      application windows during your presentation.</li>

            The menu items in the <em>Users-</em>menu are used for
            changing the
            settings of other users and interacting with them. The

            Each of the menu items in the <em>Users</em> menu are
            described here.
            A user has to be selected in the <a href="#channelsview">channels

                <li>The menu item is for sending user to user text
                  messages. A

                  you send him a
                  message. This option can however be disabled in the <a

            Subscriptions are used for ignoring certain data or events

            If e.g. you do not want to receive text messages from a

            you can tell the server that you want to unsubscribe text

                  TeamTalk currently
                  supports <em>Speex</em> and <em>CELT</em>. Speex is
                  recommende if you
                  just want to talk to other people, whereas <em>CELT</em>
                  is
                  recommended if you also want to hear music in the
                  channel. <em>CELT</em>
                  has an option to use <em>Stereo</em> but be aware
                  when choosing this
                  because many people do not have a microphone which
                  supports stereo and
                  can therefore not talk in the channel. Therefore <em>Mono</em>
                  is
                  recommended.<br>

            <h2><a name="servermenu"></a>Server-Menu</h2>
            The <em>Server</em>-menu is mainly intended for server
            administrators
            to administrate users who have access to the server. The <em>Server-</em>menu
            contains

                  Users are
                  banned based on their IP-address. Since user's
                  IP-addresses often
                  change from day to day it might be that a user who was
                  previously
                  banned can log on to the server again a day or two
                  later. Only
                  administrators can list the banned users on a server.
